# Multi-Framework Smart Contract Deployment  
### Hardhat + Foundry → Lisk Sepolia & Arc Testnet

This project demonstrates deploying the same smart contract using **two Ethereum development frameworks**:

- **Hardhat**
- **Foundry**

Both frameworks deploy to:

- **Lisk Sepolia Testnet** (ETH gas)
- **Arc Testnet** (USDC gas)

---

# Owner Contract - HardHat & Foundry

A simple ownership management smart contract deployed on **Lisk Sepolia** and **Arc Testnet** using both **Hardhat** and **Foundry** development frameworks.

The contract allows:
- Setting the deployer as the initial owner
- Changing ownership securely
- Restricting sensitive functions to the owner only
